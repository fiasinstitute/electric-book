#### The oath of allegiance

The question of oaths of allegiance, acts of acquiescence in existing
governments, and the like, is one that arises at once with the
acceptance of God as the supreme and real King of the Earth. At the
worst Caesar is a usurper, a satrap claiming to be sovereign; at the
best he is provisional. Modern casuistry makes no great trouble for the
believing public official. The chief business of any believer is to do
the work for which he is best fitted, and since all state affairs are to
become the affairs of God’s kingdom it is of primary importance that
they should come into the hands of God’s servants. It is scarcely less
necessary to a believing man with administrative gifts that he should be
in the public administration, than that he should breathe and eat. And
whatever oath or the like to usurper church or usurper king has been set
up to bar access to service, is an oath imposed under duress. If it
cannot be avoided it must be taken rather than that a man should become
unserviceable. All such oaths are unfair and foolish things. They
exclude no scoundrels; they are appeals to superstition. Whenever an
opportunity occurs for the abolition of an oath, the servant of God will
seize it, but where the oath is unavoidable he will take it.

The service of God is not to achieve a delicate consistency of
statement; it is to do as much as one can of God’s work.
